Here is a youtube link to my senior design team's Thermal Spotlight tracking me.
Note how the camera initially finds me in the dark as it uses thermal imaging to track.

While my group assisted me in creating the project, I am credited with thinking of and creating the system that tracks.
The system works by relating a matrix of returned values from a thermal camera to the camera's Field of Vision.
Then it finds the center of any large hot mass of pixels. Using the camera's FOV, we can relate where the center of the
mass is to where the camera is currently facing in degrees. Then we output to a servo how many degrees to turn and
a quick but effective method of tracking is created.
